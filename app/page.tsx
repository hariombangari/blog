        <p>
          Hey there! I&apos;m a London based software developer, currently
          crafting tech magic as a <strong>Manager - Experience Technology</strong> at <i>Publicis
          Sapient</i>. My roots trace back to the serene hills of <strong>Almora, Uttarakhand,
          India</strong>, a place as inspiring as my journey in tech. ðŸŒ„
        </p>
        <p>
          Though my academic path started with a Science degree, my heart was set
          on tech. Armed with curiosity and a self-taught approach, I leaped into
          the world of software development. What began as a web design gig soon
          evolved into a full-blown passion for <strong>frontend engineering</strong>â€”and
          eventually, a knack for mastering both <strong>frontend and backend</strong> technologies. âœ¨
        </p>
        <p>
          At <i>Publicis Groupe</i>, I&apos;m proud to be part of the team
          behind <strong>CoreAI</strong>, an innovative platform fueling AI-driven
          solutions across diverse industries.
        </p>
        <p>
          But hey, it&apos;s not all work and no play! Beyond the keyboard, I
          love hanging out with my family and friends, discovering hidden gems
          around the world, and lending a hand to others on their learning
          or project journeys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always up for an exciting challenge, a chance to collaborate, or a
          spark of innovation? Let&apos;s connect! I&apos;m open to teaming up
          on passion projects and bold ideas that push boundaries. Together, we
          can create something extraordinary! ðŸš€
        </p>
