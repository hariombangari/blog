# Welcome to my blog!

This is my first blog post written in MDX. MDX is a powerful format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your markdown documents.

## Features

- **Syntax highlighting** for code blocks
- Support for **React components**
- **Frontmatter** for metadata
- **Automatic** reading time calculation

```typescript
function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## Why MDX?

MDX allows you to use React components right alongside your markdown content. This makes it perfect for technical blog posts where you might want to include interactive demos or complex layouts.
